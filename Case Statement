# CASE STATEMENT

A case statement allows us to specify condition and it also allows us to specify what we want to return when the condition is met. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Age,
CASE 
	WHEN Age = 38 THEN 'Stanley'
	WHEN Age > 30 THEN 'OLD'
	WHEN Age BETWEEN 27 AND 30 THEN 'YOUNG'
	ELSE 'BABY'
END
FROM database1.dbo.EmployeeDetails
WHERE Age is NOT NULL
ORDER BY Age

-- we can use this to specify the particular cell.
-- In this example I used FirstName, LastName, Age
-- When Age = 38 , print 'Stanley' the name
-- When Age > 30 , Print 'OLD'
-- When Age is BETWEEn 27 AND 30 THEN 'YOUNG'



SELECT FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, Salary
FROM database1.dbo.EmployeeDetails
JOIN database1.dbo.EmployeeSalary
	ON employeeDetails.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
	
-- JOIN two tables Employee
