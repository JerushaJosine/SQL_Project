-- just add union it will show the two seperate columns into one complete table
-- It also removes the duplicates as a distinct statement



--UNION ALL  It shows all the values without removing the duplicates.

-- Just check another table values
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, Age

UNION
SELECT EmployeeID, JobTitle, Salary

ORDER by EmployeeID

--- It will still showa the output because the table coulmns are the same in this tables
__but the age and salary are showing in the same column. So, check the values are same in both tables.
